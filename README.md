# Glacier names in High Mountain Asia

Names of glaciers are recorded in the global inventories of glaciers (RGI/GLIMS). For High Mountain Asia, these are only available for less than 1% of all glaciers (see Figure 1), similar to Arctic Canada and New Zealand. Areas where glaciers are named tend to be clustered in China, the Karakoram and the Central Nepal Himalaya (Figure 2).
